# CerealAPI Project

This project provides a RESTful API for managing a collection of cereals. It includes functionalities to create, read, update, and delete cereal records, as well as to filter cereals based on specific criteria. The application is built using Python's Flask framework and interacts with an SQLite database.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete cereal records.
- **Filtering**: Filter cereals based on query parameters.
- **Concurrent Execution**: The application runs the Flask API and a test driver concurrently using multithreading.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prismicious/Uge-3.git
   cd cereal-api
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
## Usage

### Running the Application

The application is designed to run both the Flask API and a test driver concurrently. The `Main` class initializes the necessary components and starts the Flask server in a separate thread to allow the driver to perform API tests.

To start the application:

```bash
python main.py
```
## API Documentation

### Authorization

- **GET** requests do not require authentication.
- **POST**, **INSERT**, and **DELETE** requests require authentication.

### Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint             | Description                              |
|--------|----------------------|------------------------------------------|
| GET    | `/cereals`          | Retrieve all cereals                      |
| GET    | `/cereals/<id>`     | Retrieve a cereal by ID                   |
| GET    | `/cereals?key=value` | Filter cereals based on query parameters |
| POST   | `/cereals`          | Create a new cereal                       |
| POST   | `/cereals/<id>`     | Update an existing cereal by ID           |
| DELETE | `/cereals/<id>`     | Delete a cereal by ID                     |

*Note: Replace `<id>` with the actual cereal ID and `key=value` with your filter criteria.*

## Testing

The `Driver` class contains methods to test the API endpoints. It performs the following sequence of tests:

1. Retrieve a cereal by ID.
2. Retrieve all cereals.
3. Filter cereals based on manufacturer and shelf.
4. Delete a cereal by ID.
5. Create a new cereal.
6. Update an existing cereal by ID.
7. Attempt to retrieve a non-existent cereal by ID.

These tests run automatically when the application is started.

## Feedback
I would like to receive feedback on my database handling. It is what I have
the least experience with. 
My questions:
- Is this a good way to do it? 
- How can I make it more modular and flexible?
- Is it redundant to create the Cereal object when I'm not actively altering the data and just sending around dictionaries?

## Design Decisions:
- For the design of this API I have tried to adhere to RESTful practices.
- Therefore I only have one endpoint cereals/
- I have also tried to structure the code as OOP.
- To create overview for the user I added the ApiResponse class to ensure all responses are consistent and provide the relevant information.
- I tried to limit code duplication as much as possible.
- Sometime into the process I realized that I may have been better off using flask_restx to structure the api more like an enterprise version. This would make it possible to auto generate the swagger documents.
- I added the Cereal class to structure my objects - However now I wonder if this is necessary, since I don't perform any manipulation of the objects, and whether it might have been adequate to use dictionaries?
- I did not do verification on the constraints related to the Cereal class - I would add an enum called Categorical for mfr and type.
